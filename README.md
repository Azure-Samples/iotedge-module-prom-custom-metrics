# Samples of IoT Edge modules exposing Prometheus metrics 

This repository houses samples of the recommended ways to implement [module custom metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-add-custom-metrics?view=iotedge-2020-11) to integrate with [IoT Edge metrics monitoring with Azure Monitor](https://aka.ms/edgemon-docs). 

It is organized by programming language IoT Edge modules can be written in using the Azure IoT SDKs. Even if a sample in your language of choice isn't yet available, the general approach may help you.
